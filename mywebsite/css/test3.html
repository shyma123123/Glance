        The Giver is a 1993 American young adult dystopian novel written by Lois Lowry, set in a society which at first appears to be <br>
        utopian but is revealed to be dystopian as the story progresses. In the novel, the society has taken away pain and strife by <br>
        converting to "Sameness", a plan that has also eradicated emotional depth from their lives. In an effort to preserve order, <br>
        the society also lacks any color, climate, terrain, and a true sense of equality. The protagonist of the story, a 12-year-old boy named Jonas, <br>
        is selected to inherit the position of Receiver of Memory, the person who stores all the past memories of the time before Sameness. <br>
        Jonas struggles with concepts of the new emotions and things introduced to him, and whether they are inherently good, evil, or in between,<br> 
        and whether it is possible to have one without the other.The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal and has<br>
       sold more than 12 million copies worldwide. A 2012 survey by School Library Journal designated it as the fourth-best children's<br> 
       novel of all time. It has been the subject of a large body of scholarly analysis with academics considering themes of memory, religion, color,<br>
        and eugenics within the novel. In Australia, Canada, and the United States, it is required on many core curriculum reading lists in middle school,<br>
        but it is also frequently challenged. It ranked #11 on the American Library Association list of the most challenged books of the 1990s, ranked  in the<br> 2000s, and ranked in the 2010s.
        The novel is the first in a loose quartet of novels known as The Giver Quartet, with three subsequent books set in the same universe: Gathering Blue (2000),<br> Messenger (2004), and Son (2012).
         In 2014, a film adaptation was released, starring Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, and Brenton Thwaites. <br>

<div class="column">  <div class="card">   <h4> Summary</h4>
    <p class="card" style="max-width: max-content;">
        Jonas, a 12-year-old boy, lives in a Community isolated from all except a few similar towns, where everyone from small infants to 
        the Chief Elder has an assigned role. With the annual Ceremony of Twelve upcoming, he is nervous, for there he will be assigned his
         life's work. He seeks reassurance from his father, a Nurturer (who cares for the new babies, who are genetically engineered), and his mother,
          an official in the Department of Justice. He is told that the Elders, who assign the children their careers, are always right.
        The day finally arrives, and Jonas is assembled with his classmates in order of birth. The Chief elder, who presides, initially 
        passes over Jonas's turn and at the ceremony's conclusion explains that Jonas has not been given a normal assignment, but instead 
        has been selected as the next Receiver of Memory. The position of Receiver has high status and responsibility, and Jonas quickly 
        finds himself growing distant from his classmates. The rules Jonas receives further separate him, as they allow him no time to
         play with his friends and require him to keep his training secret. They also allow him to lie and withhold his feelings from his
          family, things generally not allowed in the regimented Community.
        Once he begins it, Jonas's training makes clear his uniqueness, for the Receiver of Memory is just that—a person who bears the 
        burden of the memories from all of history, and who is the only one allowed access to books beyond schoolbooks and the rulebook 
        issued to every household. The current Receiver, who asks Jonas to call him the Giver, begins the process of transferring those memories to Jonas, 
        for the ordinary person in the Community knows nothing of the past. These memories, and being the only Community member allowed access to books about the past, 
        give the Receiver perspective to advise the Council of Elders. The first memory is of sliding down a snow-covered hill on a sled, pleasantness made shocking by
         the fact that Jonas has never seen a sled, or snow, or a hill—for the memories of even these things have been given up to assure security and conformity 
         (called Sameness). Even color has been surrendered, and the Giver shows Jonas a rainbow. Less pleasantly, he gives Jonas memories of hunger and war, things 
         alien to the boy. Hanging over Jonas's training is the fact that the Giver once before had an apprentice, named Rosemary, but the boy finds his parents and 
         the Giver reluctant to discuss what happened to her.

    Jonas's father is concerned about an infant at the Nurturing Center who is failing to thrive and has received special permission 
    to bring him home at night. The baby's name will be Gabriel if he grows strong enough to be assigned to a family. He has pale
     eyes, like Jonas and the Giver. Jonas grows attached to him, especially when Jonas finds that he can receive memories. 
     If Gabriel does not increase in strength, he will be "released from the Community"—in common speech, taken Elsewhere. 
     This has happened to an off-course air pilot, to chronic rule breakers, to elderly people, and to the apprentice Rosemary. 
     After Jonas speculates about life in Elsewhere, the Giver educates him by showing the boy hidden-camera video of Jonas's father 
     doing his job: releasing the smaller of two identical twin newborns through lethal injection before putting it in a trash chute
     , since identical community members are forbidden. There is no Elsewhere for those not wanted by the Community—those said to have been 
     "released" have been killed
    Since he now considers his father a murderer, Jonas initially refuses to return home, but the Giver convinces him that without the memories, 
    the people of the Community cannot know that what they have been trained to do is wrong. Rosemary was unable to endure the darker memories of 
    the past and instead killed herself with the poison. Jonas and the Giver devise a plan to return the community's memories so they may know where they have gone wrong.
     Both agree that Jonas will leave the community thereby returning the memories to them, while the Giver will stay to help them learn to live with their memories before joining 
     his daughter, Rosemary, in death. They plan to fake Jonas's drowning to limit the search for him, but he instead must escape in a rush with Gabriel, upon learning of the child's 
     imminent release. The two are near death from cold and starvation when they reach the border of what Jonas believes must be Elsewhere. Using his ability to "see beyond", a gift
      that he does not quite understand, he finds a sled waiting for him at the top of a snowy hill. He and Gabriel ride the sled down towards a house filled with colored lights and
       warmth and love and a Christmas tree, and for the first time he hears something he believes must be music. The ending is ambiguous, with Jonas depicted as experiencing symptoms of hypothermia. 
       This leaves his and Gabriel's future unresolved. However, their fate is revealed in Messenger and Son, companion novels written years later.[10]
    In 2009, at the National Book Festival, the author joked during a Q&A: "Jonas is alive, by the way. You don't need to ask that question."[11]

        n the United States, The Giver has become frequently assigned as reading in schools, as well as library-sponsored reading clubs 
        and "City Reads" programs.
        The Giver has also frequently been the subject of bans, or attempted bans, in school libraries, due to its dark themes and violence.
         In a 2020 question-and-session, Lowry stated that the calls for banning have usually come from parents and others who have not read the book, 
         but only seen descriptions or out-of-context quotes; and that those who have called for its banning have usually changed their mind after reading it.
          Lowry has stated that she is against any censorship, and that no literature should considered off-limits.[14] Some have noted the irony of wanting to censor a 
          novel that warns about societal control of children.
        However, other reviewers have also commented that the story lacks originality and is not likely to stand up to the sort of probing 
        literary criticism used in "serious" circles. Others argue that the book's appeal to a young-adult audience is critical for building 
        a developing reader's appetite for reading.[35] Karen Ray, writing in The New York Times, detects "occasional logical lapses", but adds 
        that the book "is sure to keep older children reading".[36] Young adult fiction author Debra Doyle was more critical, stating that "Personal 
        taste aside, The Giver fails the [science fiction] Plausibility Test," and that "Things are the way they are [in the novel] because The Author 
        is Making A Point; things work out the way they do because The Author's Point Requires It."
        Children's author Natalie Babbitt, writing in The Washington Post called the novel "a warning in narrative form," saying: 
        "The story has been told before in a variety of forms—Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 comes to mind—but not, to my knowledge, for children.
         It's well worth telling, especially by a writer of Lowry's great skill. If it is exceedingly fragile—if, in other words, some situations 
         do not survive that well-known suspension of disbelief—well, so be it. The Giver has things to say that cannot be said too often, and I hope there will be many,
          many young people who will be willing to listen.[38] A review in The Horn Book Magazine stated, "In a departure from her well-known and favorably regarded realistic works, 
          Lois Lowry has written a fascinating, thoughtful science-fiction novel... The story is skillfully written; the air of disquiet is delicately insinuated. And the theme of
           balancing the virtues of freedom and security is beautifully presented."
