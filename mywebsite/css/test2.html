        The Old Man and the Sea, short heroic novel(1) by Ernest Hemingway,</br> 
        published in 1952 and awarded the 1953 Pulitzer Prize (2)for fiction.</br>
         It was his last major work of fiction. The story centres on an</br>
          aging fisherman who engages in an epic battle to catch a giant marlin(3).

<div class="column">  <div class="card">   <h4> Summary</h4>
    <p class="card">
        The central character is an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago, who has not caught </br>
        a fish for 84 days. The family of his apprentice, Manolin, has forced the boy to leave the old fisherman,</br>
         though Manolin continues to support him with food and bait. Santiago is a mentor(4) to the boy,</br> 
         who cherishes the old man and the life lessons he imparts. Convinced that his luck must change, </br>
         Santiago takes his skiff far out into the deep waters of the Gulf Stream(5), where he soon hooks a giant marlin.</br> 
         With all his great experience and strength, he struggles with the fish for three days, admiring its strength, </br>
         dignity, and faithfulness to its identity; its destiny is as true as Santiago </br>
         as a fisherman. He finally reels the marlin in and lashes it to his boat.</br>
         However, Santiago exhausting effort goes for naught. Sharks are drawn to the tethered marlin, and, </br>
         although Santiago manages to kill a few, the sharks (6) eat the fish, leaving behind only its skeleton. </br>
         After returning to the harbour, the discouraged Santiago goes to his home to sleep. In the meantime,</br>
          others see the skeleton tied to his boat and are amazed.A concerned Manolin is relieved to find Santiago alive, </br>
          and the two agree to go fishing together.

The Old Man and the Sea contains many of the themes that preoccupied Hemingway as a writer and as a man.  </br>
The routines of life in a Cuban fishing village are evoked(7) in the opening pages with a characteristic economy of language.  </br>
The stripped-down existence of the fisherman Santiago is crafted in a spare, elemental style that is as eloquently  </br>
dismissive as a shrug of the old man is powerful shoulders. With age and luck now against him, Santiago knows he must row out </br>
 “beyond all people,”away from land and into the Gulf Stream , where one last drama would be played out, in an empty arena of  </br>
 sea and sky.</br> Hemingway was famously fascinated with ideas of men proving their worth by facing and overcoming the challenges of nature.</br>
 When the old man hooks a marlin longer than his boat, he is tested to the limits as he works the line with bleeding hands </br>
 in an effort to bring it close enough to harpoon(8). Through his struggle, Santiago demonstrates the ability of the human spirit</br>
 to endure hardship and suffering in order to win. It is also his deep love and knowledge of the sea, in its impassive cruelty</br>
 and beneficence, that allows him to prevail. The essential physicality of the story—the smells of tar and salt and fish blood,</br>
 the cramp and nausea and blind exhaustion of the old man, the terrifying death spasms of the great fish—is set against the ethereal(9)</br> 
 qualities of dazzling light and water, isolation, and the swelling motion of the sea. And through it all, the narrative is constantly</br>
 tugging, unreeling a little more, and then pulling again, all in tandem with the old man is struggle. It is a story that demands to be</br>
 read in a single sitting.</br>
 The Old Man and the Sea was an immediate success and came to be regarded as one of Hemingway is finest works.</br>
  It was cited when he won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.</br>
  A hugely popular film adaptation starring Spencer Tracy was released in 1958.</br>

                an elongated body, a long dorsal fin, and a rounded spear extending from the snout. They are wanderers,

                They are consumed as food and are highly prized by sport anglers. A number of species of marlins have been named; 
                four are generally accepted as valid: the blue, black, striped, and white marlins.
